Welcome to BULAC's documentation!
===================================

BULAC is a computational model that allows exploring different conditions under which the energy matrix (including the transportation sector) of a Latin American country could be developed. This model is a tool developed by the Climate Lead Group based on the Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS), which is an open access tool that allows for local, national or multi-regional designs. 
The BULAC model has a simple structure to facilitate its use among energy sector planners, so it consists of an Excel workbook for data input (Data inputs.xlsx), a Python file with the BULAC model (MOD-BULAC.py), another Excel workbook to save results (Results Tables.xlsx) and a database base published by international organizations (e.g. OLADE energy statistics) to facilitate access to information. The structure under which these files are related is shown in the diagram below.
