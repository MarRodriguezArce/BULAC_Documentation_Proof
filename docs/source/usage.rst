Limitations of the model
-------------------------------

BULAC allows modeling the energy matrix of Latin American countries; however, it has the following limitations:

- The model has no dispatch optimization functions.
- The model approach is exploratory.
- The model omits the power grid from its analysis (e.g., line loadability, or frequency and voltage stability) and sub-hourly analysis (has annual resolution).
